Mobile app - is an absolute division of labor between internet connected, multimedia-capable device and a physical computing platform is an appealing direction for the future.


> Coronavirus can cause more severe symptoms in people with weakened immune systems, older people and those with long-term conditions like diabetes, cancer and chronic lung disease.

Gateway is an open-source solution for covid 19 situation. Ours goal is provide solution for those `4 major pillar` recommended by WHO.

We've been in those situation and manual "Guidance & Prevenence" of coronavirus  and "Back to office" or coming back to normal. Manual we mean by we still have security



*`WHO #include 4 major pillar`*

- **`0x1`**. Health Declaration (vaccinated) before enter, via QR code identification.

- `0x2`**. Wearing facemask protect yourself and others.

- **`0x3`**. Hand sanitizer regularly.

- **`0x4`**. Fever temperature recognition.



Within ours scope we define an "cost effected" "self-hostable" solution, ours goal is widespread this solution - with that in mind. We're aim to support this solution Documentation, Wiki and configuration by doing so we could encourage learner in high school, collages students build up this solution by their own.

Gateway in an application running in yours device  (ours supported architecture). It will communicate with gateway-devices with it wired sensor over Bluetooth connection protocol. By combining application and IoT devices, we’re able enable an solution for recommended    

We also encourage undergraduate, learner, students who might found interesting about “technical” aspect of the project, they could find by themselves having a “proof of concept” of how those technology work together in an ecosystem and better or excel their STEM innovation.

##### Supported architecture :
Gateway : Mobile (Android, IOS), Web (coming soon), Google Cloud Platform.

Gateway-devices: ESP32 BLE, Arduino framework.
